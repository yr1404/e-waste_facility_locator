## Start Working on this project
To start collaborating, you need to follow these steps:
- Install git on your device from this link https://git-scm.com/  
  ![git-download-button](https://github.com/yr1404/e-waste_facility_locator/assets/136597852/db1778a8-e93d-4108-8128-41f7c4e0ea4b)  
In place of Linux, this will show specific version for your specific Operating System.
  
  After installing Git, you need to go to cmd/terminal and type the git config commands:  
  `git config --global user.name "your-user-name"` and press enter  
  replace your-user-name with the github username  
  `git config --global user.email "your-email-id"` and press enter  
  replace your-email-id with the email id you provided on github  

- Now, next step is to fork this repo. To fork, just means creating a copy of this repo on your account, so that you will be able to make changes without impacting this root repo. You can do this just by clicking on this button:  
  ![fork-button](https://github.com/yr1404/e-waste_facility_locator/assets/136597852/8d7b9e3d-91ae-432b-8063-7668b825c3ba)

- You can go back to your profile and open this repo in the repositories:  
  ![repositories](https://github.com/yr1404/e-waste_facility_locator/assets/136597852/63471e83-5804-4c78-b2ad-3fdad69d9532)  
  ![e-waste repository](https://github.com/yr1404/e-waste_facility_locator/assets/136597852/7c5eba30-2361-4283-a8be-451fad8af8f3)
  
- Copy the url of this repo by clicking on Code > Copy:  
  ![copy-repo-link](https://github.com/yr1404/e-waste_facility_locator/assets/136597852/f7b53f89-1de6-4429-881f-591e9f3ee046)  

- Now, go to the folder on your PC where you want to store this repo locally.
  On linux/mac systems, right click and select open with terminal.  
  On windows, go to address bar and type cmd:  
  ![cmd](https://github.com/yr1404/e-waste_facility_locator/assets/136597852/87a3ebaa-6fbe-4dc0-9f2c-c9842cc48701)

- On cmd/terminal, type  
  `git clone repo-url`  
  replace repo-url with the url that you copied from the forked repo earlier.

- Now, make your changes that you have been assigned.  
  **Don't hesitate to make changes out of fear that you might alter the project because these changes will be done locally and can be restored, this is a perk of using GIT**
  
- After making changes you can type in cmd/terminal:
  `git status`
  to check what files have been modified.

- When you have reached a checkpoint or completed your task, you can stage and commit those changes:  
  `git add .`  
  This command will stage all the changes that you made.

  Now, to take a record (where you can get back in future) or commit the staged changes, type:  
  `git commit -m "<your-commit-message>"`  
  replace \<your-commit-message> with a message following rules in [COMMITRULES.md](./COMMITRULES.md)

- After completing the commit, now you can push your commits to your account's version of repo by using this command:  
  `git push`
  
- After completing your task and pushing the commits to the forked repo, you need to make a PR(pull request) to the root repo by clicking on the **Open Pull Request**:  
  ![open-pull-request](https://github.com/yr1404/e-waste_facility_locator/assets/136597852/fa8b262a-0024-473b-a68c-da43ad6fc8ce)

- After making the PR, sit back and relax until your PR is being reviewed.  
  You will get any suggestions for improvements if needed and after making those changes ultimately your PR will be merged to the main repo. :tada:
