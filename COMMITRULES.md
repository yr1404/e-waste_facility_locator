**While committing you must follow some rules to make them easier to read:**  

- Start the commit message with an emoji respective to the type of changes made:  
  | Type of Change          | Emoji | Code       |
  |-------------------------|-------|------------|
  | Readme or Documentation |   📝  | `:pencil:` |
  | Adding a feature        |   ⚡   | `:zap:` |
  | Fixing a bug            |   🔧  | `:wrench:` |
  | Restructuring Code/file-structure (No program behaviour Change)|   🚧  | `:construction:` |
  | Style Changes (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc) |   🎨  | `:art:` |
  | Adding or updating tests |   ✅  | `:white_check_mark:` |
  | Creating new files |   💡  | `:bulb:` |
  | Miscellaneous commits e.g. modifying `.gitignore` |   🔖  | `:bookmark:` |

- After the emoji, the first letter of the commit message should be capital.
- Your commit message should be in **third person present tense** using verbs like adds, fixes, creates, modifies, etc.

### Examples
* 📝 Updates README.md  
* 💡 Initiates project  
* 🎨 Removes empty line
* ⚡ Adds an amazing button in the footer

### Writing commit messages following these rules
As emojis are not supported by most of the command lines, we have to use code for the respective emojis:  
`git commit -m ":pencil: Updates README.md"`
